<p>When I took my first science test in first grade,I decided to work in the 
science field because everything about science always interests me. My goals 
when I get out of high school is to get a degree in the science field, work at a
good paying job,and own a house in the mountains. To achieve this goal I need to 
take AP class in science, get a good GPA, and perform well in my high 
school/college career. When I was in fifth grade, I had to work with a group of
people, to figure out the solution to a problem. My role in this project was to
find different solutions in order to figure out the answer to the problem. 
Besides doing my role I would help other finish their roles if they needed help,
and I would not just help them solve the problem but I would teach them the 
solution in a way that they would never have any more questions. I feel like 
I am a hard worker too because in 8th grade I had to create a car thatcan go 2
mph using wires and metal plates. It was a hard project my group only had 3
people, So that meant that me and my partners had to work extra. We ended up 
getting a A+ on the project because of our collabration and our effort we put 
into the project.</p>
