<p><font>Our goal by the end of this project was to make a robot which can 
travel 20 ft distance in the least amount of time possible when a pushbutton
switch is pressed to start it. When we were done we had the option to race 
multiple robots built by other teams against our robot (to determine which one 
was the fastest) or play against the clock and keep track of our time to see 
which teams robot reached the goal faster. My job in this project was being the 
Computer Engineer, while my teamates were doing their job me and my buddy were 
writing code which will move the robot foward as quick as possible.
