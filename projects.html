              <h5>Project: Robotic Car</h5>
              <h5>Course: Automachines with Robotics</h5>
              <h5>Duration: January 21th to Febuary 5th</h5>
              <h5>Objective: Make a car that can travel 20 ft in the least amount
              of time</h5>
              <h5>Type of Project: Group Project</h5>
<p><font><h5.5>Description: Our goal by the end of this project was to make a robot which can 
travel 20 ft distance in the least amount of time possible when a pushbutton
switch is pressed to start it. When we were done we had the option to race 
multiple robots built by other teams against our robot (to determine which one 
was the fastest) or play against the clock and keep track of our time to see 
which teams robot reached the goal faster. My job in this project was being the 
Computer Engineer, while my teamates were doing their job me and my buddy were 
writing code which will move the robot foward as quick as possible. My grade on 
this project was a A+, becuase we beat another group of people in a race and all 
our code was perfect. Throughout this project I learned how to use VEX Components,
and how to make a object travel faster with the help of a pushbutton and ROBOTC for 
VEX Components.

              <h5>Project: Image Manupliation</h5>
              <h5>Course: Computer Science Principals</h5>
              <h5>Duration: January 21th to Febuary 5th</h5>
              <h5>Objective: Create a family frame that creates a border with
              multiple images (Sillouthes, family text, corner border, etc) around 
              a image that the user provides.</h5>
              <h5>Type of Project: Group Project</h5>
<p><font><h5.5>Description: Our goal by the end of this project was to create a family frame,
which has the ability to change sizes and shapes depending on the user's picutes. When we were 
done with this project, we made a few changes to the code that let's the user change the color of
the code without going to the code and changing it manually. My part in this project was to code
the frame and find the perfect coordinates for all the images. The grade I got on this project was
an A, beacause I still had to make teeny tiny changes which could've made the frame better, but I was
happy with my grade because of how the hard the project. This project was a intresting one, due to all
the new code I learned and the ability to use it in future. I had a lot of difficluty in finding the right
solution, but I never gave up and successfully finished the project.
